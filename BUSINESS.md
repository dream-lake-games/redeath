# Build woes

## Local Sanity First

- Try to do a WASM build for the hell of it
    - If it doesn't work (stuff to wide) ask about any other solutions?
- Clean up wasm build (it should be a single command that does it, along with a single command to test that locally)
- Get the apple silicon build working locally
- Clean up the apple silicon build (it should be a single command)

## CI insanity

- Copy over the example CI repo carefully
- Clean up the CI repo
    - I think tagging releases is good
    - Would probably be a good idea to have the version show up in the game somewhere
        - At least do it on title screen to make it possible and easy later

# Itch Page

- Make a page for the game that is barebones
- Record exciting gameplay and put the trailer (with sound!!!) on the website
- Make some custom assets so the page looks clean and inviting
- Upload the builds

# Dream Lake Website

- Find next template to copy
- Prosper
