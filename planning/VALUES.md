# Values

## 1. Eat your vegetables

Don't do anything you know is bad. If something is necessary for the game, do it well.

## 2. Don't do things till you need them.

This only works because of #1. If you properly eat your vegetables, what this looks like is:

- You build X. You don't think Y is necessary, so you don't build it, but you design X in such a way that adding Y is not a massive fucking overhaul.
- You realize you need Y.
- You build Y.

## 3. Completion > perfection

This is _not_ any kind of fucking magnum opus or related stupid terms. You are giving yourself a month to make a _good_ game. A _complete game_. You need to build up the muscle of releasing, pubbing, etc. This requires a _complete_ game to release.

## 4. Restraints breed productivity

A.k.a you are bad at colors. You just are. Gradient palettes help you a lot. Take inspiration.
