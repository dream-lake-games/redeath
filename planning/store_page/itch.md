# Itch

Mainly just a place to chuck some notes as I'm thinking about my store page

- A good background is a must
- It should repeat and feel natural and flowy
- High quality screenshots that show _action_ but are also beautiful
    - As a sidenote, I think I need to make my lights more interesting
    - Right now they just pulse, but light things that explode lights as you run by, are more subtle (maybe attached to fireflies...) could be really cool
- Development log posts are good, especially to orient people
    - I should also put these on my personal website maybe? Idk
