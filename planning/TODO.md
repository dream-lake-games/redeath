# 0.1.1

BRAIN DUMP:

- Input buffering
- Wall jumps even more forgiving 
- Ability to change dash direction until very last moment
- Look into framerate limiting
- More clear what is solid and what isn't
- Fix chasing bug
- Scythe shoot more obvious
- Maybe make scythes go the same distance
- Double check up + drift right does not go as far right as diagonal right
- Wall kick without horizontal input does something different
- Celeste keybindings
- Controller support

OTHER STUFF:

- Blog post about what I learned from GBJam 12
- Maybe blog post about Bevy 0.15 (after 0.1.1, I've seen it a bit more)
