- [x] `handle_spawned_lids`

- [ ] Block lights only one mesh per light, not like a billion

- [ ] `move_interesting_dynos`

Remove PBR, fog, ...

Prepare assets for my custom meshes takes awhile. Not sure there's anything I can do about this though

- Some meshes take much longer than others, not sure about that... def could be a skill issue. Maybe just number of things on screen tho? Or size? Idk

Feel like should probably have a way to change update onscreen amount to whatever I want, should bump to like 12

Why does check visibility take so long?

Can I get rid of FixedUpdate?
